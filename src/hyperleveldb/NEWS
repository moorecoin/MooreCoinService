release 1.2 2011-05-16
----------------------

fixes for larger databases (tested up to one billion 100-byte entries,
i.e., ~100gb).

(1) place hard limit on number of level-0 files.  this fixes errors
of the form "too many open files".

(2) fixed memtable management.  before the fix, a heavy write burst
could cause unbounded memory usage.

a fix for a logging bug where the reader would incorrectly complain
about corruption.

allow public access to writebatch contents so that users can easily
wrap a db.
