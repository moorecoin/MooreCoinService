snappy v1.1.2, february 28th 2014:

this is a maintenance release with no changes to the actual library
source code.

  * stop distributing benchmark data files that have unclear
    or unsuitable licensing.

  * add support for padding chunks in the framing format.


snappy v1.1.1, october 15th 2013:

  * add support for uncompressing to iovecs (scatter i/o).
    the bulk of this patch was contributed by mohit aron.

  * speed up decompression by ~2%; much more so (~13-20%) on
    a few benchmarks on given compilers and cpus.

  * fix a few issues with msvc compilation.

  * support truncated test data in the benchmark.


snappy v1.1.0, january 18th 2013:

  * snappy now uses 64 kb block size instead of 32 kb. on average,
    this means it compresses about 3% denser (more so for some
    inputs), at the same or better speeds.

  * libsnappy no longer depends on iostream.

  * some small performance improvements in compression on x86
    (0.5鈥?%).

  * various portability fixes for arm-based platforms, for msvc,
    and for gnu/hurd.


snappy v1.0.5, february 24th 2012:

  * more speed improvements. exactly how big will depend on
    the architecture:

    - 3鈥?0% faster decompression for the base case (x86-64).

    - armv7 and higher can now use unaligned accesses,
      and will see about 30% faster decompression and
      20鈥?0% faster compression.

    - 32-bit platforms (arm and 32-bit x86) will see 2鈥?%
      faster compression.

    these are all cumulative (e.g., arm gets all three speedups).

  * fixed an issue where the unit test would crash on system
    with less than 256 mb address space available,
    e.g. some embedded platforms.

  * added a framing format description, for use over e.g. http,
    or for a command-line compressor. we do not have any
    implementations of this at the current point, but there seems
    to be enough of a general interest in the topic.
    also make the format description slightly clearer.

  * remove some compile-time warnings in -wall
    (mostly signed/unsigned comparisons), for easier embedding
    into projects that use -wall -werror.


snappy v1.0.4, september 15th 2011:

  * speeded up the decompressor somewhat; typically about 2鈥?%
    for core i7, in 64-bit mode (comparable for opteron).
    somewhat more for some tests, almost no gain for others.
  
  * make snappy compile on certain platforms it didn't before
    (solaris with sunpro c++, hp-ux, aix).

  * correct some minor errors in the format description.


snappy v1.0.3, june 2nd 2011:

  * speeded up the decompressor somewhat; about 3-6% for core 2,
    6-13% for core i7, and 5-12% for opteron (all in 64-bit mode).

  * added compressed format documentation. this text is new,
    but an earlier version from zeev tarantov was used as reference.

  * only link snappy_unittest against -lz and other autodetected
    libraries, not libsnappy.so (which doesn't need any such dependency).

  * fixed some display issues in the microbenchmarks, one of which would
    frequently make the test crash on gnu/hurd.


snappy v1.0.2, april 29th 2011:

  * relicense to a bsd-type license.

  * added c bindings, contributed by martin gieseking.

  * more win32 fixes, in particular for msvc.

  * replace geo.protodata with a newer version.

  * fix timing inaccuracies in the unit test when comparing snappy
    to other algorithms.


snappy v1.0.1, march 25th 2011:

this is a maintenance release, mostly containing minor fixes.
there is no new functionality. the most important fixes include:

  * the copying file and all licensing headers now correctly state that
    snappy is licensed under the apache 2.0 license.

  * snappy_unittest should now compile natively under windows,
    as well as on embedded systems with no mmap().

  * various autotools nits have been fixed.


snappy v1.0, march 17th 2011:

  * initial version.
